# zScript
Yet another esoteric language. Mainly inspired from Zig's language design, in a more scripted way.

## Work In Progress

This project is a learning experience.

Based on my previous work in [nyasharp](https://github.com/AI-nsley69/nyasharp), which was created by following [craftinginterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com), alongside my own ideas and suggestions from other people.

## TODO

- [x] Fix scoping on variables (limited to one variable name wherever)
- [ ] Add support for a module-like system
- [ ] Add support for grouping values together
- [ ] Strings!
- [ ] Other data structures (i.e, list, tuples, etc)
- [ ] Type checking & specifying types
- [ ] General improvements of syntax (such as no curly if's)
- [ ] Anonymous functions
